## Installation

1. Install `@nuxtjs/storybook` dependency to your project:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest module add storybook
```

2. Add it to your `modules` section in your `nuxt.config`:

::code-group

```ts [nuxt.config (Nuxt 3)]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtjs/storybook'],
})
```

```ts [nuxt.config (Nuxt 2)]
export default {
  buildModules: ['@nuxtjs/storybook'],
}
```

::

3. Prepare [Storybook config files](#storybook-config-files).

::alert{type="success"}
That's it! You can now use `Storybook` in your Nuxt app ✨
::

::alert{type="info"}
Discover your Stories directly with the `Storybook Devtools tab`.

### Nightly Builds

The nightly release channel allows you to test the latest updates and features, directly from the most recent commits. This is useful for experimenting with new features, improvements, and bug fixes before they are included in the stable release.

#### Opting in to the nightly release

To use the nightly version, follow these steps:

- Modify the `@nuxtjs/storybook` dependency in your `package.json` to use the latest nightly release:

  ```json
  {
    "devDependencies": {
      "@nuxtjs/storybook": "npm:@nuxtjs/storybook@nightly"
    }
  }
  ```

- Remove the lockfile and reinstall the dependencies using your package manager to ensure the nightly release is installed.

#### Opting out of the nightly release

If you need to revert to the stable release, follow these steps:

- Change the `@nuxtjs/storybook` dependency in `package.json` back to the stable version:

  ```json
  {
    "devDependencies": {
      "@nuxtjs/storybook": "latest"
    }
  }
  ```

- Remove the lockfile and reinstall the dependencies to revert to the stable release.

## Storybook config Files

When running `npm run dev`, this module will look for these files:

- `.storybook/main.{ts,js}`
- `.storybook/preview.{js,cjs,mjs,ts}`

You can create these files manually or by running the following command:

```bash
npx storybook-nuxt init
```

::alert{type="info"}
If you want to auto launch storybook after init pass `--start`
If you want to enable Nuxt module pass `--enable-module`
::

## Options

You can customize the module's behavior by using the `storybook` property in `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  storybook: {
    // Options
    url: 'http://localhost:6006',
    port: 6006,
  },
})
```

See the [module options](/getting-started/options).
