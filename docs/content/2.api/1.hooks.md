## Config Hook

As of Version 3 `@nuxtjs/storybook` will provide API for modules to modify Storybook config and add their own stories. Modules can use `storybook:config` hook to access Storybook config and add their own stories.

<alert type="info">
It is highly recommended to create your stories under <code>Modules</code>. This is best way to keep storybook clean. Take a look at below example. <a href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/naming-components-and-hierarchy">Read more about naming</a>
</alert>

Here is a sample example:

::code-group

  ```js{}[my-module/index.js]
  export default function() {
    const { nuxt } = this

    nuxt.hook('storybook:config', ({ stories }) => {
      stories.push("my-module/stories/*.stories.js")
    })
  }
  ```

  ```js{}[my-module/awesome.stories.js]
  export default {
    title: "Moduels/Awesome Module"
  }

  export const awesomeStory = () => "<div>AWESOME</div>"
  ```

::

Just like that, now everyone that uses `my-module` will see your story inside Storybook.
