        ## Search for existing issues

        Please carefully [search for related issues (open and closed)](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/storybook/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and make sure you're not submitting a duplicate issue.
        If you find anything that seems like the same bug, it's much better to comment on an existing thread than create a duplicate.

        ## Check nightly builds

        We are constantly improving the module and it's possible that the issue you're experiencing has already been fixed in the latest nightly build.
        Please try to reproduce the issue with the [latest nightly build](https://storybook.nuxtjs.org/getting-started/setup#nightly-builds) and see if it still persists.

        It is important to provide a minimal reproduction of the issue you're experiencing. This makes it easier to understand the problem and to find a solution.
        Issues without a reproduction might be closed immediately.

        The best way to create a minimal reproduction is by modifying the [Showcase example](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/storybook/tree/main/examples/showcase),
        and open a PR with the minimal changes that reproduce the issue.
        Alternatively, you can use the [StackBlitz template](https://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt-modules/storybook/tree/main/examples/starter) to create a minimal reproduction.
